# ProjectEulerAsm
Solutions to Project Euler problems (at https://projecteuler.net) in x86-64 assembly language.

I solved said problems with assembly because i wanted to practice it, and the challenges seemed like a good and fun opportunity to do so.
I chose to use 64 bit assembly because of the many large number operations.
